This gives you the best of both world:

1. `typeof TAX_CODES` will be `"OT" | "COT"` and not just a string
2. But if you put an invalid code here, it will complain!

`satisfies` is here to verify the constraints of a type are respected, without changing the type itself!

It's a way to check things are true when they could get wrong.
