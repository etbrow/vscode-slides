# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Slides** extension will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [4.1.0] - 2022-12-28

### Changed

- Make "Visual Studio Light" the default theme. It renders Markdown files correctly and "Github Clean White" seems to have broken with recent VS Code updates. Plus, it's a default theme so that's less custom stuff to install.

### Fixed

- The way we read & write settings have been reimplemented using node's fs instead of the VS Code API. This fixes a bunch of issues related to existing settings that were sometimes overwritten by the extension. Kudos to @lucasfeliciano for fixing these!

## [4.0.0] - 2020-04-08

### Removed (breaking)

- `slides.theme` and `slides.fontFamily` configuration. These can now be configured directly with the new `slides.vscodeSettings` object that was added (see details below).

### Added

- Thanks to [@omnoms](https://github.com/omnoms), you can now override Slides settings with the `slides.vscodeSettings` object. It takes a VS Code setting configuration and will apply it on top of Slides default settings when you enter presentation mode.

For example, if you want to change the theme, font family and font size of the presentation mode, set the following configuration in your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "slides.vscodeSettings": {
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Frantic Light (rainglow)",

    "editor.fontFamily": "Arial",
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Arial",

    "editor.fontSize": 42
  }
}
```

Any valid VS Code setting will work.

Have a look at [Slides default settings](https://github.com/nicoespeon/vscode-slides/blob/master/src/settings.ts) to learn more.

### Fixed

- It was not possible to configure Slides settings in the Workspace because the settings were overridden by the extension itself. This is now fixed. You can configure Slides from anywhere üëç

## [3.2.1] - 2020-02-06

### Fixed

- In recent versions of VS Code, settings didn't have time to be saved before opening the slides, resulting in a non-functionning behavior. We now give enough time to the editor to save the settings before opening the slides, so *it works*‚Ñ¢.

## [3.2.0] - 2019-12-09

### Changed

- If you set `previewMarkdownFiles` to `true`, all Markdown previews will open instead of the raw files when presentation starts. That means no more glitches when moving to the next slide üëå

## [3.1.0] - 2019-12-02

### Added

- New setting called `folder`. If you prefer to put your slides in a subfolder, you can configure the relative path to this folder.

- New setting called `previewMarkdownFiles`. When `true` it uses preview mode for Markdown slides. When the user moves away from the Markdown slide, the preview is closed and regenerated for the next Markdown file:

## [3.0.0] - 2019-11-23

### Changed

- **(Breaking)** Change keybinding for Windows and Linux users, so it doesn't conflict with VS Code defaults one. Now you'd use `Ctrl Shift Alt ‚Üí` to go to the next slide and `Ctrl Shift Alt ‚Üê` to go to the previous one.

## [2.0.3] - 2019-11-19

### Fixed

- Workspace folder path on Windows, so the extension can work

## [2.0.2] - 2019-11-19

### Fixed

- Make path to settings OS agnostic, so the extension can work on Windows too

## [2.0.1] - 2019-11-03

### Fixed

- When you have a large number of slides (like 60+), Slides will open all of them in the correct order. It won't be instant, but it will be in the correct order (and still quite fast).

## [2.0.0] - 2019-10-26

### Breaking changes

- Leverage VS Code workspace data storage to persist the state. Slides won't create a `.vscode-slides.json` in your workspace anymore, which is great! But that means it won't rely on the existing ones, so **it will consider current settings to be the default ones**. You might need to reset them manually.

### Added

- Make **theme** and **font family** configurable.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-10-24

### Added

- Improve README instructions to get started with the Extension

## [0.2.1] - 2019-10-24

### Fixed

- Specify macOS shortcuts for navigation so they work too

## [0.2.0] - 2019-10-23

### Breaking changes

- Change navigation shortcuts to use `Ctrl` instead of `Alt`, so we don't override standard shortcuts as it's a less common combination.

### Fixed

- Make the extension work when workspace has no settings set.
- Gracefully handle when files can't be open.
- Give VS Code enough time so we're sure we open all slides & we focus on the first one.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-10-22

### Added

- **Toggle Slides mode**. It applies optimized settings for VS Code when activated, and reset original settings when deactivated.
- **Open all files in alphabetical order** when activated.
- **Shortcuts to navigate between slides** when activated.
- **Shortcut to deactivate Slides** when activated.
